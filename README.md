This project  uses machine learning to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its components.
It employs various algorithms and techniques to build an accurate predictive model.
The dataset includes features like cement,blast furnace slag,fly ash,water,superplasticizer,coarse aggregate,and fine aggregate
